            I was asked to create a campaign for the Summer Residencies 2025,
            organized by Rosas and P.A.R.T.S. It was a great honor to have this
            as my first real paid assignment. They requested something simple,
            not too special, and in line with both of their styles. I was
            immediately inspired by their logo, which looks as if it was written
            in chalk. So I started experimenting with chalk and Illustrator!<br /><br />
            I developed two styles: one in color, reflecting the style of
            P.A.R.T.S., and one in black and white for Rosas, which matches
            their aesthetic.

            In 2023, I joined Canapé Brussels, a space centered around
            community, art, and creating opportunities for each other. I created
            a graphic identity inspired by the friend books we used to fill out
            as kids. The style is designed to be easy to reproduce, allowing
            every team member to work with it using the elements I put together.
            <br /><br />
            This year I had the opportunity to design and make a website for
            Canapé.

            In my third year at Luca School of Arts, I had the opportunity to
            participate in an Erasmus exchange in Lyon, where I studied at ENSBA
            (École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts). During that semester,
            we were given an interesting assignment: to create a custom font
            inspired by the typefaces of old newspapers. We were provided with a
            selection to choose from, and I decided to work with the font from
            Le Meridional. <br />
            <br />
            This was my first experience designing a typeface, which made the
            project particularly exciting for me. Upon returning to Belgium, I
            continued to refine and develop the font, making the entire process
            a rewarding journey. For the final presentation, I decided to
            showcase the font in a newspaper format, incorporating various
            headlines, paying homage to the historical roots of the original
            typeface.

            In my second year at Luca School of Arts, we were assigned to create
            a concept for a fictional radio station and design a poster to
            represent it. I came up with "Radio Scream", a station dedicated
            entirely to iconic screams from movies. For the poster, I featured
            several films known for their unforgettable scream scenes. Each
            title was accompanied by details such as the length of the scream
            and the name of the specific scene, emphasizing the power and drama
            of these moments.

            holds an annual contest for the graphic design of their festival,
            and I decided to submit my design—and ended up winning. <br />
            <br />
            Hekeko stands for Heverlee, Kessel-Lo, and Korbeek-Lo, so I
            incorporated the geographical borders of these areas into the poster
            and added a 3D effect to make them stand out. Once I had the concept
            in place, I experimented with the layout, and that's how the final
            design came together!

            In 2023, I began studying Multimedia and Creative Technology at
            Erasmushogeschool Brussel. As part of a course called Interactive
            Motion, we learned to use TouchDesigner. The course culminated in
            two assignments, one of which involved creating a project inspired
            by another artist’s work. I chose Daydream by Valentine Maurice, an
            artist known for exploring the effects of light on mental health. In
            this particular project, she experiments with the interplay between
            light and water. For my project, I focused on recreating this
            interaction, experimenting with recreating light and water in
            TouchDesigner.

            In my second year at Luca School of Arts, we were tasked with
            designing a football scarf using a limited set of materials, themed
            around a sport of our choice. After researching the materials, I
            decided to create a scarf inspired by the board game Go. <br />
            <br />
            The contrast between the grid of the board and the round playing
            stones influenced my design. I drew further inspiration from a
            computer version of Go that highlights the best moves with gradient
            colors. I used these gradient colors throughout the rest of the
            scarf. These colors allowed key elements—such as the repeating
            "gogogogo" on the back and the white stone-like dots on the front—to
            stand out more clearly.

            This assignment was from my first year at Luca School of Arts, where
            we were tasked with designing a vinyl cover for one of the albums
            from a provided list. I chose "Music for Commercials" by Yasuaki
            Shimizu, an album originally created for Japanese TV commercials.<br />
            <br />
            For inspiration, I delved into vintage Japanese commercials, which
            are known for their vibrant and colourful aesthetic. During my
            research, I also discovered tiny smiley faces in Japanese signage,
            which was a fun addition to my design. Overall, designing this vinyl
            was a fun experience, full of creativity and exploration.

            In my third year at Luca School of Arts, we kicked off the year with
            a major assignment: designing a book on graphic design. We were
            provided with interviews and essays from graphic designers to
            include in our book. For inspiration, we had to base our design on
            an existing book we liked. While browsing a thrift store, I came
            across a book about antiques. Its unique design featured large text
            and cut-out elements that intrigued me. I decided to incorporate
            these features into my project, experimenting with the interplay
            between bold typography and cut-out imagery. The result was a book
            design that combined these elements in a creative and engaging way.

            In 2023, I started a new study, diving deeper into various programs
            and techniques. This clip is an example of one of my first
            experiments with After Effects. It's a lyric video where I applied
            the new skills I acquired throughout the year. <br />
            <br />
            The song featured is "My Little Tony" by Bar Italia. Inspired by
            their album cover, which showcases stretched text, a color palette
            of gray, black, and yellow, and a grainy texture, I incorporated
            these elements into the video to create a cohesive and visually
            engaging piece.

            In 2023, I began studying Multimedia and Creative Technology at
            Erasmushogeschool Brussel. In the Interactive Motion course, we
            explored TouchDesigner and were tasked with two significant
            assignments. For the second assignment, we created an interactive
            digital installation that delved into human interaction with
            technology.<br />
            <br />
            I wanted to challenge the notion that technology is a
            black-and-white world. Instead, I aimed to demonstrate its
            complexity by allowing viewers to influence what they see through
            hand and head movements. This clip showcases the interactive visual
            I developed to explore this concept.

            This is my masters project, Juliet and Romeo. It was a research to
            the iconic story 'Romeo and Juliet'. In my masters thesis I wrote a
            story about Romeo and Juliet, in the story I researched and thought
            of how every element takes its place in today's society. When
            researching, I also looked at how this story was visualised, since
            there are a lot of versions of it. I layered them and created
            pictures where the romeos and juliets come out distorted.
